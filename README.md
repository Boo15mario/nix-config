# Nix Configuration Repository

This repository contains Nix configuration files for my systems and utility scripts.

## Directory Structure

- **System Folders**: Each folder (e.g., `boo76`, `hp-boo`) contains the NixOS configuration files specific to that system.
- **Root Scripts**: The shell scripts located in the root directory are general-purpose utility scripts intended for use on all systems.
